This is my Quarto website. It's part of my #30DaysOfQuarto project. My current goals are to:

1.  Learn Quarto.

2.  Make a website that reflects a new Minimum Viable Product each day.

3.  Do something about my ToBeRead Pile.

Toolchain for this one:

-   RStudio including Quarto

-   [Quarto.pub](https://quartopub.com/), a free site from Posit for publishing using Quarto

Some useful resources for this one are:

-   All things [Quarto](https://quarto.org)

-   Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel's very useful Get Started guides [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

-   Josh French's [Creating Websites with Quarto and Github](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkrJrLs7xfbXcEKhTCKRSr2VXH4yiBeXo "A step by step approach that integrates GitHub.") playlist on Youtube.

-   Isabella Velásquez on [Building a Blog with Quarto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVcvXfRyfE0)
